## Getting Started

### Install

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/mh-superbox/unipi-control-os/releases) `unipi-control-os-neuron-rpi3-64-1.x.img.xz`.
2. Write the image to your SD card with [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher).
3. Insert SD card to your Unipi Neuron and power the system on.
4. Connect to your Unipi Neuron with `ssh unipi@unipi.local` (The username and password are `unipi`).
5. Run `sudo opkg install unipi-control` to install Unipi Control.
6. Read the [documentation](https://github.com/mh-superbox/unipi-control#configuration) to configure your Unipi Neuron and copy the configuration files to `/usr/local/etc/unipi`.

Now you can start the service with:

```shell
